def yolo_non_max_suppression(scores, boxes, classes, max_boxes = 10, iou_threshold = 0.5):
    """
    Applies Non-max suppression (NMS) to set of boxes
    
    Arguments:
    scores -- tensor of shape (None,), output of yolo_filter_boxes()
    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), output of yolo_filter_boxes() that have been scaled to the image size (see later)
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), output of yolo_filter_boxes()
    max_boxes -- integer, maximum number of predicted boxes you'd like
    iou_threshold -- real value, "intersection over union" threshold used for NMS filtering
    
    Returns:
    scores -- tensor of shape (, None), predicted score for each box
    boxes -- tensor of shape (4, None), predicted box coordinates
    classes -- tensor of shape (, None), predicted class for each box
    
    Note: The "None" dimension of the output tensors has obviously to be less than max_boxes. Note also that this
    function will transpose the shapes of scores, boxes, classes. This is made for convenience.
